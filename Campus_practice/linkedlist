->Theta show the exact eg: asympototic time complexity to add a node at the end of singly linked list, if the pointer is initally to head of the list "Theta(n)".

->The concatenation of two list can be performed in O(1) time, it is the circular doubly linked list not doubly linked list.

->Array implementation of linked list is the best item at position n. 

->Linked list is suitable for the implementation of
insertion sort, radix sort and polynomial manipulation not binary search.

->Linked list is an example of dynamic memory allocation.
